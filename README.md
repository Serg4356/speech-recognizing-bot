# Speach recognizing bot

### Description

There are two bots(telegram, and vk group) with auto text recognizing in this repo. Text recognizing is provided by Google's [DialogFlow](https://dialogflow.com/). Bots automatically recognize user's intent and response with one(or more) prepared answer. You can use it for make your personal auto helper or modify it to make more complex automatic response system for your company, blog, store etc.

You can easily make modifications and deploy it on your personal or open server platforms. Current version of bot doesn't support long conversations (one question - one answer), but it can be easily fixed too.

You can get chatting expirience by messaging my telegram bot - @serg4356_speach_recognizing_bot, or [here](https://vk.com/club182829172). Or simply look at gif below:
